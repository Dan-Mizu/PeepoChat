I am currently working alone on this project. I develop on the side and dream of making it my main source of income. Any donations would be greatly appreciated.

### **Developing**

Typescript is easy to develop with, as it is essentially just Javascript with type-safety. This project uses the Vue javascript framework which is known to be one of, if not _THE_, easiest javascript frameworks out there. With the Tauri framework, we wrap web apps into a standalone cross-platform desktop app.

You can clone this repository, make changes, and then submit a pull request. Reach out to me on Discord (@DanMizu) if you are interested or have absolutely _ANY_ questions.

1. **Install npm, Rust, and Visual Studio Code**

You can install NPM (Node Package Manager) from: <https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm>. The LTS is fine.

You can install Rust from: <https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>

Visual Studio Code is a great editor for web development and is obtained from: <https://code.visualstudio.com/>

You can use any other editor, though this project is configured with tasks and run configurations for VSCode.

2. **Clone this Repo**

Theres a button for this at the top right of this repo. I personally use the Github Desktop app to clone repos easily.

3. **Open the Repo in Visual Studio Code and Install Dependencies**

You can open the repo directly from Github Desktop after its been cloned. Use the shortcut CTRL+SHIFT+P (CMD+SHIFT+P on MacOS) and type and/or select `Task: Run Tasks`, then `Install Dependencies`.

4. **Develop**

The source code for the front end is located within `/src/`, and assets are within `src/assets`.

5. **Debug**

If using VSCode, you can use the "Run and Debug" tab on the left to run different configurations. `Dev | Web` will start a Vite server that can be accessed from the URL it gives you in the console. `Dev | Tauri` will run the Vite server, build the app, then launch it.

If you want to build the app yourself, you can use the `Build` task.

6. **Submit Changes For Review and Merging**

When you're finished implementing a new feature, push your changes (it will prompt you to fork the main repository) then submit a pull request to the main repository. This process is detailed here: <https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions>.
